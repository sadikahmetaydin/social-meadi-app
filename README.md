# Socilay - Full Stack Social Media App âœ¨

This social media app project was built entirely with modern web technologies, combining Firebase and React to deliver a streamlined, real-time user experience.

Using React for the frontend, I crafted a modular and responsive interface enhanced with TailwindCSS for sleek styling and Heroicons for intuitive interaction elements. Behind the scenes, Firebase Authentication provides secure Google Sign-In capabilities, while Firestore acts as the real-time database, enabling instant tweet syncing and updates via ``onSnapshot``.

To support media-rich posts, Firebase Storage was integrated, allowing users to upload and display images alongside their tweets. Time-based operations like sorting and timestamping were handled with Firestoreâ€™s built-in ``serverTimestamp`` function. For content management, ``deleteDoc`` ensures users can safely remove their own tweets, maintaining a controlled and personalized experience.

React Hooks like ``useState`` and ``useEffect`` manage component state and lifecycle events, creating a smooth and reactive application environment.

This stack of technologies comes together to form a compact yet powerful Twitter-style application, built with scalability and user-centered design in mind.
